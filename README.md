# Recognizer-digits

Here I have used the MNIST data set, to train a Convolutional Neural Network which is better suited for image processing because they are less sensitive to where in the image, the pattern we are looking for is located.

With a multi-layer perceptron, I achieved only around 97% accuracy. But the CNN was able to get an accuracy above 99\%
