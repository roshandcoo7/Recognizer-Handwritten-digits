# Recognizer-digits

Here I have used the MNIST data set, to train a Convolutional Neural Network that's better suited for image processing. CNN's are less sensitive to where in the image the pattern is that we're looking for.

With a multi-layer perceptron, I achieved only around 97% accuracy. But the CNN was able to get an accuracy above 99\%
